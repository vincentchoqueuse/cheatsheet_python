Exercice 2
++++++++++

Let us consider the following second order polynomial

.. math ::

    p(x) = a_2x^2+a_1x +a_0.

The polynomial coefficients are stored in the list :code:`coefs = [1, -0.2, 0.4]`. Write a Python program that evaluates and displays the value of :math:`p(x)`. To evaluate each term, it is recommended to use 
the mathematical operator :code:`**` that raises the number on the left to the power of the exponent of the right (for example :code:`2**3` corresponds to :math:`2^3``.) 

**Specifications**

* Program Name: :code:`02_math.py`
* Input: a float :code:`x` (must be provided by the user using :code:`input` function)
