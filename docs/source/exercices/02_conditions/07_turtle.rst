* if :code:`L` is strictly lower to 2, the program does not draw any shape,
* if :code:`L` is equal to 2, the program must draw a triangle with three sides with equal length of 100,
* if :code:`L` is strictly greater then 2, the program must draw a square with side length 100.

**Specifications**

* Program Name: :code:`chap2_ex7.py`
* Library: :code:`turtle` (see `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html>`__)
