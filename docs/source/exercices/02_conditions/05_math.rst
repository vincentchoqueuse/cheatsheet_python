Exercice 5
++++++++++

Write a Python program that computes a price reduction. 
The initial price is stored in a variable :code:`price`. The reduction price is then computed from the customer :code:`age`.

* When :code:`age < 12`, the program must apply a reduction of 50%,
* When :code:`age < 18`, the program must apply a reduction of 25%,
* When :code:`age >= 18`, the program must not apply any reduction.

For example if :code:`price = 100` and :code:`age = 16`, the program must display the value :code:`75`.

**Specifications**

* Program Name: :code:`chap2_ex5.py`
* Input: an integer :code:`age` and a float :code:`price` (must be provided by the user using :code:`input` function)
