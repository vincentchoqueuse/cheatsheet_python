Introduction
============

This webpage contains a small course with exercices for Python programming. As reported on the `TIOBE Index <https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>`_, Python is now 
the most popular programming language. As compared to other languages, Python is easy to learn and provide many modules, libraries and
frameworks.

Choosing Python can be a game changer in many fields.

* **Data Analysis** Tired of using Excel for storing and manipulating your data ? Python is the "swiss army knife" for data analysis. It can read and write data in spreadsheets or in database. It can also perform complicated computation using powerful scientific libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib or Seaborn. 

* **Machine Learning** Want to test if a particular "Convolution Network" is able to predict some informations from your recorded data ? Python is the de-facto programming language in Machine Learning, thanks to powerful frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow or Scikit-Learn.

* **Web development** Want to present your algorithm in a website ? Python contains powerful frameworks for back-end web development such as Flask and Django.


Installation
++++++++++++

To program python codes, you basically need:

* A computer with Windows, Linux or MacOS operating system. Programming Python code using a Nano computer (such as the Raspberry Pi) is also quite commun nowadays,
* A Python 3 distribution, 
* A text editor.

Regarding the text editor, you can use whatever you want. Personally, I recommend to use the software VSCode from Microsoft (https://code.visualstudio.com).
The following tutorial shows how to install a Python distribution on your computer and how to configure VSCode to play nicely with Python using 
dedicated extensions. This tutorial proposes to install a simple Python Interpreter. Nevertheless, if you plan to use Python mainly for data science applications, I recommend to 
install the Anaconda Distribution for Python since it includes many useful libraries.
