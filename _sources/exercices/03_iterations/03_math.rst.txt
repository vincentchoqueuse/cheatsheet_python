.. math ::

    s_n = s_{n-1} + s_{n-2}

where the sequence is initialized with :math:`s_0=0` and :math:`s_1=1`. For example, the first terms of the sequence are given by :math:`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`.

**Specifications**

* Program Name: :code:`chap3_ex3.py`
* Input: an integer :code:`L` (must be provided by the user using :code:`input` function)
