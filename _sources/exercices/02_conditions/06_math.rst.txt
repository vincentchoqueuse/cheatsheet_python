Exercice 6
++++++++++

Let us consider the following second order polynomial

.. math ::

    p(x) = a_2x^2+a_1x +a_0.

The polynomial coefficients are assumed stored in a list equal to :code:`coefs = [1, -0.2, 0.4]`. Write a python program that computes and displays the value of the roots of :math:`p(x)`. 

**Specifications**

* Program Name: :code:`chap2_ex6.py`
* Input: a float :code:`x` (must be provided by the user using :code:`input` function)
