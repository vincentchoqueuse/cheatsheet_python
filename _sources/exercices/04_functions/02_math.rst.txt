Create a Python function that computes the mean (i.e. the average) of a list of numbers. 

**Prototype**

    :name: `mean`
    :inputs: number_list (a list of float)
    :outputs: a number (float)

**Test**

After the instruction 
:code:`output = mean([19, 15, 5, 11])`,  the value of output must be 12.5.
