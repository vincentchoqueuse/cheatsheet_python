Exercice 4
++++++++++

Create a function `power` that computes the value of :math:`y = x^k` without using the standard function :code:`pow` of the Python library.

To compute the mathematical power, it is recommended to use a loop.

**Prototype**

    :name: `power`
    :inputs: 
        * x (a float)
        * k (an integer)
    :outputs: y (a float)

**Test**

After the instruction :code:`output = power(2, 3)`, the value of output must be 8.
